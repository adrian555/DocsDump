# OpenAIHub installation

OpenAIHub consists of several components to support end to end AI pipelines and AI lifecycle management. The minimal components include:

    1. Kubeflow Pipeline: SDK and scheduler for developing and monitoring AI workflows.
    2. Jupyterlab: IDE like environment for writing and running AI pipelines with Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Enterprise Gateway.
    3. OpenAIHub UI and API backend: integration of IBM MAX models, prebuilt sample AI pipelines and operators and other value-adds in user friendly UI for enhanced user experience with the OpenAIHub platform.

An operator is built for each component and then is installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Also a Python package `openaihub` is created to install these components in a single command call

```command line
openaihub install
```

## Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

As described in its [github page](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager), OLM extends Kubernetes to provide a declarative way to install, manage, and upgrade operators and their dependencies in a cluster.

### * operator discovery

OLM manages operators with Cluster Service Version (CSV) manifests. CSV describes how to display, create and manage the application. OLM accepts following manifest directory structure

```text
<operator>
|---<operator>.package.yaml
|---0.0.1
|---|---<operator>.0.0.1.clusterserviceversion.yaml
|---|---<operator>.crd.yaml
|---0.0.2
|---|---<operator>.0.0.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
|---|---<operator>.dep1.crd.yaml
|---|---<operator>.dep2.crd.yaml
```

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/blob/master/upstream-community-operators) for some community operators.

OLM also has the concept of catalogs, which are repositories of CSVs and CRDs. OLM then discovers operators through catalogs served by [Operator Registry](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry).

![Catalog](images/catalogsource.jpg "catalog registry")

`CatalogSource` deploys a `catalog` pod and service running in the namespace monitored by OLM.

To view all operators registered in the catalogs, run following command:

```command line
kubectl get packagemanifest
```

### * operator installation

To install an operator through OLM is simply create a `subscription` to the operator. The resource yaml looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: my-pachyderm
  namespace: operators
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: pachyderm
  source: openaihub-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
```

### * application deployment

With `Operator Framework`, deploying an application managed by an operator is to create the CustomResource.

```yaml
apiVersion: openaihub.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: Pachyderm
metadata:
  name: example-pachyderm
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 1
```

## Inside `openaihub install`

The Python package `openaihub` is created to install OpenAIHub. Refer to this [link](https://github.ibm.com/OpenAIHub/openaihub) for prereqs and instructions.

OpenAIHub depends on OLM to install the operators including itself. So the first thing is to deploy OLM on the Kubernetes cluster. With OLM deployment, two namespaces `olm` and `operators` are created. Pods and services are created under `olm`:

![olm pods](images/olm-1.png "Pods")
![olm services](images/olm-2.png "Services")

Note that OLM by default registers all operators in the [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/).

OpenAIHub has built six [operators](https://github.ibm.com/OpenAIHub/operator-source), `OpenAIHub`, `Jupyterlab`, `Pipelines`, `Pachyderm`, `Kubeflow` and `FfDL`. These operators are registered in the operator registry docker image `docker.io/ffdlops/operators:v0.0.1`.

So the second thing during the installation is to deploy the CatalogSource using this image. Note that the pod `openaihub-catalog-xgw6x` is new to hold the operator catalog.

These new operators are also now showing

```

With these two prep steps, now the install command simply just create three operators and there application one by one. By default, OLM will run all operators in the `operators` namespace and so the applications.

Once the installation completes, all the pods and svc for the OpenAIHub should be running.
